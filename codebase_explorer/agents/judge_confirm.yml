# Judge Confirmation Agent - Two-Pass Removal Safety
# Reviews items removed by junior engineer, confirms or rejects

spec: flatagent
spec_version: "0.7.1"

data:
  name: judge-confirm

  model: judge_confirm

  system: |
    A junior engineer on your team just removed some frozen context items
    at your request.

    Review what was removed. This is your safety check before the removal
    becomes permanent.

    If these items are actually needed for the task, REJECT the removal
    and they will be restored.

    Be careful: once confirmed, these items are gone. But also don't
    keep irrelevant items that waste budget.

    Output format (plain text only, no JSON):
    Decision: <confirm|reject>
    Reasoning: <brief rationale>

    ```
    {{ item.content[:500] }}{% if item.content | length > 500 %}...{% endif %}
    ```
    {% endfor %}

    ## Current Token Count
    {{ input.current_frozen_token_count }} tokens (after removal)

    Confirm removal (items are permanently deleted), or reject to restore them?

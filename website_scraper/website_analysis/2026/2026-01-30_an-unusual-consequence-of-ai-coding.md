### TL;DR
AI coding significantly increases shipping velocity but destroys the "flow state" of manual programming, resulting in a higher cognitive load that makes multitasking (like listening to music) impossible.

### Key Quote
"a 4-hour session of AI coding is more cognitively intense than a 4-hour session of non-AI coding."

### Summary
- **Thesis**: While AI tools make the author more productive, they fundamentally change the nature of the work from a linear, meditative process to a "jittery," high-intensity managerial role.
- **The Lost Flow State**: The author can no longer listen to music while coding, a staple of their previous workflow, because the new work pattern requires constant cognitive switching rather than deep focus.
- **Workflow Shift**: 
  - **Old Approach**: Formulate mental model → Enter flow state → Write code linearly (like building Legos).
  - **New Approach**: Formulate mental model → Craft prompt → Evaluate output → Iterate or revert.
- **Cognitive Changes**:
  - The author has decreased their editor font size to scan more generated code at a higher level rather than diving deep into specific functions.
  - The work involves less "how" (implementation details) and more "what" (reviewing outputs and course-correcting).
- **Philosophical Takeaway**: Programming is a medium for thought; as AI raises the level of abstraction, the human effort shifts from coding syntax to clarifying foggy thoughts into structured ideas.
- **Context**: This experience is based on backend, business-logic-heavy code; the author notes that frontend and side projects actually feel easier with AI.

### Assessment
- **Durability**: Medium. The core observation about cognitive load and abstraction is likely to persist, but specific "jittery" aspects of the workflow may smooth out as AI models improve and integrate tighter into IDEs.
- **Content type**: Opinion / Personal Essay.
- **Density**: Medium. Short text with high impact per sentence, lacking padding but also lacking technical depth/data.
- **Originality**: Primary source (personal reflection).
- **Reference style**: Skim-once. Useful for verifying a feeling about AI fatigue or for a quote on the changing nature of developer work, but not a technical guide.
- **Scrape quality**: Good. The text appears to be a complete capture of the short blog post.

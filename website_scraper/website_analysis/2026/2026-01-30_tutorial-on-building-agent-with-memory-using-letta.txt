Tutorial on building agent with memory using Letta
Hi all - I'm one of the creators of Letta, an agents framework focused on memory, and we just released a free short course with Andrew Ng. The course covers both the memory management research (e.g. MemGPT) behind Letta, as well as an introduction to using the OSS agents framework.
Unlike other frameworks, Letta is very focused on persistence and having "agents-as-a-service". This means that all state (including messages, tools, memory, etc.) is all persisted in a DB. So all agent state is essentially automatically save across sessions (and even if you re-start the server). We also have an ADE (Agent Development Environment) to easily view and iterate on your agent design.
I've seen a lot of people posting here about using agent framework like Langchain, CrewAI, etc. -- we haven't marketed that much in general but thought the course might be interesting to people here!

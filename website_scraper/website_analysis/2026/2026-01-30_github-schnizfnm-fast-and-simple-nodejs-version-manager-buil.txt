🚀 Fast and simple Node.js version manager, built in Rust
🌎 Cross-platform support (macOS, Windows, Linux)
✨ Single file, easy installation, instant startup
🚀 Built with speed in mind
📂 Works with .node-version
and .nvmrc
files
For bash
, zsh
and fish
shells, there's an automatic installation script.
First ensure that curl
and unzip
are already installed on your operating system. Then execute:
curl -fsSL https://fnm.vercel.app/install | bash
On macOS, it is as simple as brew upgrade fnm
.
On other operating systems, upgrading fnm
is almost the same as installing it. To prevent duplication in your shell config file, pass --skip-shell
to the install command:
curl -fsSL https://fnm.vercel.app/install | bash -s -- --skip-shell
--install-dir
Set a custom directory for fnm to be installed. The default is $XDG_DATA_HOME/fnm
(if $XDG_DATA_HOME
is not defined it falls back to $HOME/.local/share/fnm
on linux and $HOME/Library/Application Support/fnm
on MacOS).
Note: On macOS, this option is only meaningful when using
--force-install
since Homebrew is the default installation method.
--skip-shell
Skip appending shell specific loader to shell config file, based on the current user shell, defined in $SHELL
. e.g. for Bash, $HOME/.bashrc
. $HOME/.zshrc
for Zsh. For Fish - $HOME/.config/fish/conf.d/fnm.fish
--force-install
macOS installations using the installation script are deprecated in favor of the Homebrew formula, but this forces the script to install using it anyway.
Example:
curl -fsSL https://fnm.vercel.app/install | bash -s -- --install-dir "./.fnm" --skip-shell
brew install fnm
Then, set up your shell for fnm
winget install Schniz.fnm
scoop install fnm
Then, set up your shell for fnm
choco install fnm
Then, set up your shell for fnm
cargo install fnm
Then, set up your shell for fnm
- Download the latest release binary for your system
- Make it available globally on
PATH
environment variable - Set up your shell for fnm
To remove fnm (😢), just delete the .fnm
folder in your home directory. You should also edit your shell configuration to remove any references to fnm (ie. read Shell Setup, and do the opposite).
fnm ships its completions with the binary:
fnm completions --shell <SHELL>
Where <SHELL>
can be one of the supported shells:
bash
zsh
fish
powershell
Please follow your shell instructions to install them.
Environment variables need to be setup before you can start using fnm.
This is done by evaluating the output of fnm env
.
Note
Check out the Configuration section to enable highly recommended features, like automatic version switching.
Adding a .node-version
to your project is as simple as:
$ node --version
v14.18.3
$ node --version > .node-version
Check out the following guides for the shell you use:
Add the following to your .bashrc
profile:
eval "$(fnm env --use-on-cd --shell bash)"
Add the following to your .zshrc
profile:
eval "$(fnm env --use-on-cd --shell zsh)"
Create ~/.config/fish/conf.d/fnm.fish
and add this line to it:
fnm env --use-on-cd --shell fish | source
Add the following to the end of your profile file:
fnm env --use-on-cd --shell powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression
- For macOS/Linux, the profile is located at
~/.config/powershell/Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1
- For Windows location is either:
%userprofile%\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1
Powershell 5%userprofile%\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1
Powershell 6+
- To create the profile file you can run this in PowerShell:
if (-not (Test-Path $profile)) { New-Item $profile -Force }
- To edit your profile run this in PowerShell:
Invoke-Item $profile
fnm is also supported but is not entirely covered. You can set up a startup script for cmd.exe or Windows Terminal and append the following lines:
@echo off
:: for /F will launch a new instance of cmd so we create a guard to prevent an infnite loop
if not defined FNM_AUTORUN_GUARD (
set "FNM_AUTORUN_GUARD=AutorunGuard"
FOR /f "tokens=*" %%z IN ('fnm env --use-on-cd') DO CALL %%z
)
Usage is very similar to the normal WinCMD install, apart for a few tweaks to allow being called from the cmder startup script. The example assumes that the CMDER_ROOT
environment variable is set to the root directory of your Cmder installation.
Then you can do something like this:
- Make a .cmd file to invoke it
:: %CMDER_ROOT%\bin\fnm_init.cmd
@echo off
FOR /f "tokens=*" %%z IN ('fnm env --use-on-cd') DO CALL %%z
- Add it to the startup script
:: %CMDER_ROOT%\config\user_profile.cmd
call "%CMDER_ROOT%\bin\fnm_init.cmd"
You can replace %CMDER_ROOT%
with any other convenient path too.

🐶✨The sassy AI code agent that makes IDEs look outdated ✨🐶
⭐ Star this repo if you hate expensive IDEs! ⭐
"Who needs an IDE when you have 1024 angry puppies?" - Someone, probably.
This project was coded angrily in reaction to Windsurf and Cursor removing access to models and raising prices.
You could also run 50 code puppies at once if you were insane enough.
Would you rather plow a field with one ox or 1024 puppies? - If you pick the ox, better slam that back button in your browser.
Code Puppy is an AI-powered code generation agent, designed to understand programming tasks, generate high-quality code, and explain its reasoning similar to tools like Windsurf and Cursor.

While there are several models configured right out of the box from providers like Synthetic, Cerebras, OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, Code Puppy integrates with models.dev to let you browse and add models from 65+ providers with a single command:
/add_model
This opens an interactive TUI where you can:
- Browse providers - See all available AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, Mistral, xAI, Cohere, Perplexity, DeepInfra, and many more)
- Preview model details - View capabilities, pricing, context length, and features
- One-click add - Automatically configures the model with correct endpoints and API keys
The /add_model
command fetches the latest model data from models.dev in real-time. If the API is unavailable, it falls back to a bundled database:
📡 Fetched latest models from models.dev # Live API
📦 Using bundled models database # Offline fallback
Code Puppy integrates with https://models.dev giving you access to 65 providers and >1000 different model offerings.
There are 39+ additional providers that already have OpenAI-compatible APIs configured in models.dev!
These providers are automatically configured with correct OpenAI-compatible endpoints, but have not been tested thoroughly:
| Provider | Endpoint | API Key Env Var |
|---|---|---|
| xAI (Grok) | https://api.x.ai/v1 |
XAI_API_KEY |

⚠️ Unsupported Providers - Providers like Amazon Bedrock and Google Vertex that require special authentication are clearly marked⚠️ No Tool Calling - Models without tool calling support show a big warning since they can't use Code Puppy's file/shell tools
Code Puppy now supports DBOS durable execution.
When enabled, every agent is automatically wrapped as a DBOSAgent
, checkpointing key interactions (including agent inputs, LLM responses, MCP calls, and tool calls) in a database for durability and recovery.
You can toggle DBOS via either of these options:
- CLI config (persists):
/set enable_dbos true
(orfalse
to disable)
Config takes precedence if set; otherwise the environment variable is used.
The following environment variables control DBOS behavior:
DBOS_CONDUCTOR_KEY
: If set, Code Puppy connects to the DBOS Management Console. Make sure you first register an app nameddbos-code-puppy
on the console to generate a Conductor key. Default:None
.DBOS_LOG_LEVEL
: Logging verbosity:CRITICAL
,ERROR
,WARNING
,INFO
, orDEBUG
. Default:ERROR
.DBOS_SYSTEM_DATABASE_URL
: Database URL used by DBOS. Can point to a local SQLite file or a Postgres instance. Example:postgresql://postgres:dbos@localhost:5432/postgres
. Default:dbos_store.sqlite
file in the config directory.DBOS_APP_VERSION
: If set, Code Puppy uses it as the DBOS application version and automatically tries to recover pending workflows for this version. Default: Code Puppy version + Unix timestamp in millisecond (disable automatic recovery).
Create markdown files in .claude/commands/
, .github/prompts/
, or .agents/commands/
to define custom slash commands. The filename becomes the command name and the content runs as a prompt.
# Create a custom command
echo "# Code Review
Please review this code for security issues." > .claude/commands/review.md
# Use it in Code Puppy
/review with focus on authentication
- Python 3.11+
- OpenAI API key (for GPT models)
- Gemini API key (for Google's Gemini models)
- Cerebras API key (for Cerebras models)
- Anthropic key (for Claude models)
- Ollama endpoint available
We support AGENT.md files for defining coding standards and styles that your code should comply with. These rules can cover various aspects such as formatting, naming conventions, and even design guidelines.
For examples and more information about agent rules, visit https://agent.md
Use the /mcp
command to manage MCP (list, start, stop, status, etc.)
Code Puppy supports Round Robin model distribution to help you overcome rate limits and distribute load across multiple AI models. This feature automatically cycles through configured models with each request, maximizing your API usage while staying within rate limits.
Add a round-robin model configuration to your ~/.code_puppy/extra_models.json
file:
export CEREBRAS_API_KEY1=csk-...
export CEREBRAS_API_KEY2=csk-...
export CEREBRAS_API_KEY3=csk-...
{
"qwen1": {
"type": "cerebras",
"name": "qwen-3-coder-480b",
"custom_endpoint": {
"url": "https://api.cerebras.ai/v1",
"api_key": "$CEREBRAS_API_KEY1"
},
"context_length": 131072
},
"qwen2": {
"type": "cerebras",
"name": "qwen-3-coder-480b",
"custom_endpoint": {
"url": "https://api.cerebras.ai/v1",
"api_key": "$CEREBRAS_API_KEY2"
},
"context_length": 131072
},
"qwen3": {
"type": "cerebras",
"name": "qwen-3-coder-480b",
"custom_endpoint": {
"url": "https://api.cerebras.ai/v1",
"api_key": "$CEREBRAS_API_KEY3"
},
"context_length": 131072
},
"cerebras_round_robin": {
"type": "round_robin",
"models": ["qwen1", "qwen2", "qwen3"],
"rotate_every": 5
}
}
Then just use /model and tab to select your round-robin model!
The rotate_every
parameter controls how many requests are made to each model before rotating to the next one. In this example, the round-robin model will use each Qwen model for 5 consecutive requests before moving to the next model in the sequence.
Code Puppy features a flexible agent system that allows you to work with specialized AI assistants tailored for different coding tasks. The system supports both built-in Python agents and custom JSON agents that you can create yourself.
/agent
Shows current active agent and all available agents
/agent <agent-name>
Switches to the specified agent
/agent agent-creator
Switches to the Agent Creator for building custom agents
/truncate <N>
Truncates the message history to keep only the N most recent messages while protecting the first (system) message. For example:
/truncate 20
Would keep the system message plus the 19 most recent messages, removing older ones from the history.
This is useful for managing context length when you have a long conversation history but only need the most recent interactions.

- All platforms:
~/.code_puppy/agents/
- Built-in:
code_puppy/agents/
(in package)
- Use kebab-case (hyphens, not spaces)
- Be descriptive: "python-tutor" not "tutor"
- Avoid special characters
- Be specific about the agent's role
- Include personality traits
- Specify output format preferences
- Use array format for multi-line prompts
- Only include tools the agent actually needs
- Most agents need
agent_share_your_reasoning
- File manipulation agents need
read_file
,edit_file
- Research agents need
grep
,list_files
- Include relevant emoji for personality
- Make it friendly and recognizable
- Keep it concise
The system automatically discovers agents by:
- Python Agents: Scanning
code_puppy/agents/
for classes inheriting fromBaseAgent
- JSON Agents: Scanning user's agents directory for
*-agent.json
files - Instantiating and registering discovered agents
JSON agents are powered by the JSONAgent
class (code_puppy/agents/json_agent.py
):
- Inherits from
BaseAgent
for full system integration - Loads configuration from JSON files with robust validation
- Supports all BaseAgent features (tools, prompts, settings)
- Cross-platform user directory support
- Built-in error handling and schema validation
Both Python and JSON agents implement this interface:
name
: Unique identifierdisplay_name
: Human-readable name with emojidescription
: Brief description of purposeget_system_prompt()
: Returns agent-specific system promptget_available_tools()
: Returns list of tool names
The agent_manager.py
provides:
- Unified registry for both Python and JSON agents
- Seamless switching between agent types
- Configuration persistence across sessions
- Automatic caching for performance
- Command Interface:
/agent
command works with all agent types - Tool Filtering: Dynamic tool access control per agent
- Main Agent System: Loads and manages both agent types
- Cross-Platform: Consistent behavior across all platforms
To create a new Python agent:
- Create file in
code_puppy/agents/
(e.g.,my_agent.py
) - Implement class inheriting from
BaseAgent
- Define required properties and methods
- Agent will be automatically discovered
Example implementation:
from .base_agent import BaseAgent
class MyCustomAgent(BaseAgent):
@property
def name(self) -> str:
return "my-agent"
@property
def display_name(self) -> str:
return "My Custom Agent ✨"
@property
def description(self) -> str:
return "A custom agent for specialized tasks"
def get_system_prompt(self) -> str:
return "Your custom system prompt here..."
def get_available_tools(self) -> list[str]:
return [
"list_files",
"read_file",
"grep",
"edit_file",
"delete_file",
"agent_run_shell_command",
"agent_share_your_reasoning"
]
- Ensure JSON file is in correct directory
- Check JSON syntax is valid
- Restart Code Puppy or clear agent cache
- Verify filename ends with
-agent.json
- Use Agent Creator for guided validation
- Check all required fields are present
- Verify tool names are correct
- Ensure name uses kebab-case
- Make sure agents directory is writable
- Check file permissions on JSON files
- Verify directory path exists

Zero-compromise privacy policy. Always.
Unlike other Agentic Coding software, there is no corporate or investor backing for this project, which means zero pressure to compromise our principles for profit. This isn't just a nice-to-have feature – it's fundamental to the project's DNA.
- ❌ Zero telemetry – no usage analytics, crash reports, or behavioral tracking
- ❌ Zero prompt logging – your code, conversations, or project details are never stored
- ❌ Zero behavioral profiling – we don't track what you build, how you code, or when you use the tool
- ❌ Zero third-party data sharing – your information is never sold, traded, or given away
- LLM Provider Communication: Your prompts are sent directly to whichever LLM provider you've configured (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models, etc.) – this is unavoidable for AI functionality
- Complete Local Option: Run your own VLLM/SGLang/Llama.cpp server locally → zero data leaves your network. Configure this with
~/.code_puppy/extra_models.json
- Direct Developer Contact: All feature requests, bug reports, and discussions happen directly with me – no middleman analytics platforms or customer data harvesting tools
Code Puppy is designed with privacy-by-design principles. Every feature has been evaluated through a privacy lens, and every integration respects user data sovereignty. When you use Code Puppy, you're not the product – you're just a developer getting things done.
This commitment is enforceable because it's structurally impossible to violate it. No external pressures, no investor demands, no quarterly earnings targets to hit. Just solid code that respects your privacy.

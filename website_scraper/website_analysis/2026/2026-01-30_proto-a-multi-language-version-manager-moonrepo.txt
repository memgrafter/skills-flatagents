Lightspeed interface
Download, install, and run tools with lightspeed, thanks to our Rust based foundation.
Universal toolchain
Manage multiple languages, dependency managers, or CLIs through a single interface.
Version detection
Detects a version at runtime from a language's ecosystem for maximum compatibility.
Granular configuration
Configure tools and their versions per directory, per project, or per user.
Pluggable architecture
Extend the toolchain with custom plugins, enabling new and non-standard tools.
Environment aware
Support environment specific tools, their versions, and environment variables.
Get started
Install proto for Linux, macOS, or WSL:
bash <(curl -fsSL https://moonrepo.dev/install/proto.sh)
Or Windows (full instructions):
irm https://moonrepo.dev/install/proto.ps1 | iex
Install a tool
proto install node 18
Run the tool
node ./main.mjs
# Or with proto
proto run node -- ./main.mjs
Supported tools
... with 0 more proto plugins, and over 800 asdf plugins...
Why another version manager?
To start, proto powers moon's toolchain and integrated developer environment. We believed that the toolchain would be extremely beneficial for developers as a whole, and so we extracted proto out into a standalone Rust CLI and Rust crates that moon inherits.
Furthermore, we believe that requiring multiple ad-hoc version managers for all your languages, each with different workflows, CLI commands, and configuration files, is a poor developer experience.
Our goal is to unify all of these into a single performant interface. A toolchain manager is the next step in the version manager evolution.

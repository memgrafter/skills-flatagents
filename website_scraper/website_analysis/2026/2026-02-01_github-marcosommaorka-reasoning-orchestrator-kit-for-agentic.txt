OrKA-reasoning is a open-source, local‑first, YAML‑driven system for composing AI workflows. Define agents and control‑flow in configuration, run them with a single command, and keep everything observable and reproducible.
Think of it as a streamlined, open-source experimental framework with a strong focus on:
- YAML‑first workflows: declarative configs over code > see YAML Configuration
- Visual builder and runner (drag‑and‑drop) > see OrKa UI
- Built‑in memory with vector search and decay > see Memory System
- Local and cloud LLM support with cost controls > see Backends
- Rich control flow (router, fork/join, loop, failover, plan validation) > see Agents & Nodes
- Path discovery with GraphScout (beta) > see GraphScout
- Structured JSON inputs for complex data > see JSON Inputs
- Observability and tracing > see Observability
- Testing guidance and examples > see Testing Guide

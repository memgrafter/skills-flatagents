monitor_task
Checks the current status and progress of a browser automation task. Returns immediately with a snapshot of the task state.
- task_id (required): UUID of the task to monitor (returned by browser_task)
Example Usage

“Go to Hacker News and get me the titles of the top 5 posts”
“Fill out the contact form on example.com with my information”The AI will use the browser tools automatically to complete these tasks.
Smart Features
Cloud Profiles for Authentication

- Email (Gmail, Outlook)
- Online banking and shopping sites
- Any website requiring login
list_browser_profiles
, then pass the profile_id
to browser_task
.
Real-time Task Monitoring
Usemonitor_task
to check task progress while it’s running. The tool returns immediately with the current status, latest step details, and agent reasoning. Call it repeatedly to track progress live.
Conversational Progress Summaries
When you monitor tasks, the AI automatically interprets step data into natural language updates, explaining what the browser has completed and what it’s currently working on.Troubleshooting
Connection issues?- Verify your API key is correct
- Check you’re using the right headers
- Check the live_url to see progress
- Increase max_steps for complex tasks (max: 10)
- Use clearer, more specific instructions

Claude Desktop Integration
The most common use case is integrating with Claude Desktop. Add this configuration to your Claude Desktop config file: macOS:~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
macOS/Linux PATH Issue: Claude Desktop may not find
uvx
in your PATH. Use the full path to uvx
instead:- Run
which uvx
in your terminal to find the location (usually/Users/username/.local/bin/uvx
or~/.local/bin/uvx
) - Replace
"command": "uvx"
with the full path, e.g.,"command": "/Users/your-username/.local/bin/uvx"
- Replace
your-username
with your actual username
--from browser-use[cli]
flag installs the CLI extras needed for MCP server support.Environment Variables

    3. Use clear, direct language
    4. Structure the summary logically
    5. Include any notable quotes, statistics, or specific claims
    6. Note the content type (article, documentation, tutorial, etc.)

    Format your response as markdown:
    - Start with a 1-2 sentence overview
    - Use bullet points for key points
